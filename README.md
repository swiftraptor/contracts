## Smart Contracts

### ERC721Whitelist
A whitelist is necessary when distributing ERC721 tokens amongst a small, pre-selected group of future token holders. This contracts supports a relatively complex form of whitelisting - every whitelisted address has a number of tokens associated with it, tokens which are sold at a special, _whitelist only_ price. This contract also supports airdrop functionality.
